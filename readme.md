# Ferrite

Ferrite is a stack-oriented interpreted language based on [FORTH](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)>) and [FACTOR](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_(programming_language)>).

Ferrite was designed one night when I wanted to make a language specifically to do [Advent of Code](<https://adventofcode.com>) in, so most of the initial features will be geared toward solving those problems.<br>
Despite this, Ferrite is a robust and very usable language.

**Note:** Ferrite isn't in 1.0 yet, so many things are subject to change

## Installation
